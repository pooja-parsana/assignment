        "A database is a collection of related data that is organized and stored in a structured manner, allowing efficient retrieval and management of the data. A database can be anything from a simple collection of data to a complex system with multiple tables, relationships, and constraints. Databases are commonly used in modern software applications to store and retrieve information.\n",

        "\n",
        "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, store data in tables with a fixed structure consisting of rows and columns. SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. SQL databases are highly structured and require a predefined schema, which defines the structure of the data and its relationships. The schema must be designed before any data can be added to the database. Some popular SQL databases are MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, NoSQL databases, also known as non-relational databases, do not store data in tables but use other data models such as document, key-value, column-family, or graph. NoSQL databases use various query languages such as MongoDBâ€™s query language, Cassandra Query Language, or Apache HBase query language, which are not as standardized as SQL. NoSQL databases are highly scalable, flexible, and can handle large volumes of unstructured data. Some popular NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
