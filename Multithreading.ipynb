        "\n",
        "1. `run()`: This method is called when a thread is started using the `start()` method. It contains the code that will be executed by the thread. When a thread is started, it begins executing its `run()` method concurrently with the main thread.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. `join()`: This method waits for a thread to complete its execution. When a thread is joined, the main thread will block until the joined thread has completed its `run()` method. If the joined thread is still running when `join()` is called, the main thread will wait until the thread completes before continuing.\n",
        "\n",

        "In summary, `run()` and `start()` are methods associated with the code that will be executed by a thread, while `join()` and `isAlive()` are methods associated with the management of threads. `join()` can be used to wait for a thread to complete before continuing, while `isAlive()` can be used to check whether a thread is still running."

Each thread has its own stack and can execute independently of the others, but they share the same memory space and can access the same variables and data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Increased performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to take advantage of the available CPU resources. By dividing a program into multiple threads, it can execute more instructions in parallel, which can lead to faster execution times.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, a user interface can continue to respond to user input while a background task is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Resource sharing: Multithreading can make it easier to share resources between different parts of a program. For example, a thread that is responsible for loading data from a network can run concurrently with a thread that is responsible for processing that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Modularity: Multithreading can make it easier to divide a complex program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each thread can focus on a specific task or aspect of the program, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",

        "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead, both in terms of memory usage and CPU time. Each thread requires its own stack and execution context, which can increase the memory footprint of the program. Additionally, context switching between threads can incur additional CPU overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Synchronization: Multithreading requires proper synchronization to ensure that shared resources are accessed safely and correctly. This can add additional complexity to the program and can be a potential source of bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Scalability: Multithreading does not necessarily scale linearly with the number of CPU cores or threads. In some cases, adding additional threads can actually decrease performance due to contention for shared resources or overhead from context switching.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, multithreading can offer significant performance benefits and improve the responsiveness of a program, but it can also introduce complexity and overhead. Proper synchronization and design are necessary to ensure that shared resources are accessed safely and correctly, and to avoid concurrency-related issues such as race conditions and deadlocks."

In other words, each thread is waiting for the other to release a resource that it needs in order to proceed. As a result, none of the threads can make progress, and the program becomes stuck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deadlocks typically occur when threads are accessing shared resources in an inconsistent manner. For example, if one thread acquires a lock on a resource and then waits for another resource that is locked by a second thread, while the second thread is waiting for the first resource that is locked by the first thread, a deadlock can occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "A race condition, on the other hand, occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of two or more threads. In other words, the result of the program depends on which thread executes first, rather than on the logic of the program itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Race conditions typically occur when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization. For example, if two threads try to modify the same variable at the same time, the result may depend on the order in which the threads execute. If the threads do not coordinate their access to the variable properly, the result can be unpredictable or incorrect.\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid deadlocks and race conditions, it's important to use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, and barriers, to coordinate access to shared resources. It's also important to ensure that threads acquire and release locks in a consistent order to avoid deadlocks. Additionally, it's important to design your program to minimize the amount of shared state and to use immutable data structures whenever possible, to reduce the likelihood of race conditions."
