        "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of defining a simplified representation of something, with the goal of making it easier to work with. In OOP, abstraction involves creating classes that represent real-world objects or concepts, and defining methods and attributes that provide a simplified interface for working with those objects or concepts.\n",

        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably. This means that you can create code that works with a variety of objects, without having to know the specific details of each object's class. In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through the use of duck typing, which allows objects to be treated as if they belong to a particular class based on their behavior.\n",
