    "   - R-squared only considers the number of variables included in the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Objective**:\n",
    "   - R-squared aims to maximize the explained variance in the dependent variable, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "   - Adjusted R-squared aims to find the balance between model fit and model simplicity. It accounts for the trade-off between adding more variables and fitting the data better.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Higher or Lower Values**:\n",
    "   - R-squared can never decrease when additional variables are added to the model. It might remain the same or increase.\n",

    "**Interpretation of Adjusted R-squared**:\n",
