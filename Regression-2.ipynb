This penalty term encourages the model to balance between fitting the training data well and keeping the model's complexity in check. Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso modify the traditional linear regression model to achieve this balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset with a single independent variable (feature) and a dependent variable (target), and you want to fit a linear regression model to predict the target. Without regularization, a traditional linear regression model might try to fit the training data as closely as possible, even if it means capturing noise and small fluctuations in the data.\n",

    "- **Model A (RMSE = 10)**: This model has a Root Mean Squared Error of 10, indicating that, on average, the predictions are off by around 10 units in the same scale as the dependent variable. RMSE puts more weight on larger errors due to the squaring operation.\n",

    "**Choosing the Better Model**:\n",

    "- **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Both RMSE and MAE can be influenced by outliers. RMSE is more sensitive due to squaring errors, whereas MAE is less sensitive.\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable Scale**: RMSE is influenced by the scale of the dependent variable, while MAE is not. Thus, if the dependent variable is measured in different units, it might impact the relative importance of the metrics.\n",
